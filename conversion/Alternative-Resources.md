As you learn more about Linux and other open source projects, your
questions will become far more complex. Obviously, not every advanced
topic or question can be covered on this wiki. With that in mind, here
is a list of alternative resources to turn to when you have open source
or Linux related questions.

| Resource                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                              | Link                                        |
