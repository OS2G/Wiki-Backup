Given that it’s highly likely we will have to spend more funding in the
future, this is a brief guide on how to use the funding.

Once funding is in our SOFS account, this is the process by which to use
it.

# Go Card

First, we have to get a Go card from the SOFS office. This is a debit
card that is linked to our SOFS account. Additionally, it has to be
issued specifically in someone’s name. Finally, another form is required
to be signed by the President and Treasurer to transfer funds from the
account to the card so that purchases can be made.

# Reimbursement

Reimbursement from SOFS requires a specific form to be submitted. Once
the form is submitted over Nvolve U 2.0, a check in the individuals name
will be at SOFS
