### Server

  - Installathon?
      - use server to supply distros and use network boot
  - May not want to put it in CSE
      - May be able to get a room to put it in

### Committees

  - Sam will contact Michael M. about the constitutional comm.
  - Samâ€™s proposition: special interest groups can be formed that have
    the option to become committees
      - give them official recognition so they can get rooms
      - keep bureaucracy to a minimum
      - include non-members
  - Financial comm. and events comm. would be useful
      - Events comm. can help generate ideas for events
  - Committees should be defined before they are formed
      - Take care of the bureaucratic stuff early
      - Form in February?

### Misc.

  - Next club meeting on Friday
      - Produce wiki materials on using GitIt
      - Map out February events (at least first 2 weeks)
      - Fourth Friday as LAN party
      - Possibly discuss digital responsibilities
