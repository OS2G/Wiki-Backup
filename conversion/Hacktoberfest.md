Hacktober is a collective creative effort. Whatever you build, go make
it. In the spirit of this collaborative effort our focus this month is
on encouraging members to pursue their pipedream products and to
collaborate or scheme with likeminded individuals.

Our goal this month is simple and boils down to one word: T-Shirts.

Should a person make four commits on Github and they are accepted by the
owner of the repository, that person will become a proud owner of a new
T-Shirt.

Any individual who receives such a T-Shirt must therefore have set up
their own development environment and learned enough Git to take part.
With these two things those who are entirely new to coding are now able
to learn development in their own time, on their own machine, and can
get involved with whatever projects they stumble upon in the future.
