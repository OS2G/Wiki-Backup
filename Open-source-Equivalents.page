There are many open-source equivalents for every piece of closed-source
software and hardware. This page will provide a list of equivalents for
many common closed-source pieces of software.

  Common Software                      Open-source Equivalent                                                                             Information
  ------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Windows / Mac OS                     [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)                                                       Linux is an open-source operating system that has many free distributions that the general public may use.
  Microsoft Office                     [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org) / [Open Office](https://www.openoffice.org)            Both are open-source equivalents of the Microsoft Office Suite. Both can use and save in the Microsoft Office format.
  Internet Explorer / Microsoft Edge   [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox) / [Chromium (Chrome)](https://www.chromium.org)   Both are open-source browsers that are just as good if not better than the Microsoft Equivalents.
  Photoshop                            [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org)                                                                       A very robust and feature filled program that can do many of the same things Photoshop can. Takes a little bit to get used to.
