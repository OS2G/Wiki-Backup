Please note, before doing either action described herein, you must first
[create an account](Special:CreateAccount).

Creating a Page
---------------

After making a thorough search as to whether the page you would like to
create does not already exist or if a very similar page does not already
exist, in the search bar, search for the page you would like to create,
then click on the “create this page” link underneath the search options.
That will take you to create the page you were searching for if it does
not exist.

Editing a Page
--------------

To edit a page, simply go to the page in question and select “Edit” in
the menu on the upper left side in line with the search box.

Content & Formatting
--------------------

The point of this wiki is to inform and help others. Don't create a page
or make an edit to be funny, that won't help anyone and will only cause
turmoil for everyone.

Simply be informative in your works with a lack of bias/opinion allowing
for information to be spread in the best and least tainted way possible.

To learn formatting, there are many useful pages on the Mediawiki
