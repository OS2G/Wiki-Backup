# Frequently Asked Questions
In this section, this wiki guide will address various questions and responses gathered from OS2G members.

## How do I import a model from Blender into Unity?
Once your object is ready to import, click on File > Export and choose the desired format. It is highly recommend to use the **Collada (.dae)** format, as that is a universally recognized format for 3D models.

## How do I scale an object in Blender?
In Blender, the "Tools" menu contains a Transform menu. By default, this is located in the top left corner of the window. Under Transform, there is a **Scale** option. Once you select the scale option, a Resize menu should appear in the bottom left corner of the window. There, you can resize your object by adjusting individual axes. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut S to scale an item. If you press your middle mouse button you will change the axis it scales on.
