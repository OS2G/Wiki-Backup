**Shell** is a user interface for access to an operating system's
services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line
interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a
computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it
is the outermost layer around the operating system kernel.

On most systems, access to the shell happens through Command Prompt
(Windows) or Terminal (Unix-based) when trying to use CLI. Running
commands and programs using CLI can be very useful as much more control
can be achieved as well as more information is typically displayed to
the user.

### Common Commands

  Command   Usage                                                                  Syntax
  --------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cd        Changes directory                                                      \$ cd /directory/subdirectory or ../subdirectory (.. goes up one directory)
  ls        Lists all current files and folders in a directory                     \$ ls -a (-a shows all files and folders including hidden ones)
  mkdir     Allows creation of a new directory                                     \$ mkdir testFolder
  cp        Copies files (or folder) to another location                           \$ cp /directory/originalFile /newDirectory/copiedFile
  mv        Moves files (or folder) to another location                            \$ mv /directory/originalFile /newDirectory/movedFile
  rm        Removes files or folders (deletes permanently)                         \$ rm testFiles or rm -r testFolder (-r is recursive, allowing the removal of folders filled with files)
  man       Shows documentation for a program / command                            \$ man cd
  grep      Searches for a string in a file or program output                      \$ grep -i “testString” testFile
  ssh       Allow tunneling to a remote shell (remote desktop, but only for CLI)   \$ ssh user@host.domain
  top       Shows a list of current running processes on the computer              \$ top -u userName (-u will only show processes ran by a certain user)
  exit      Ends current session                                                   \$ exit

Many commands have help files, to access them, append
&lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the command which will
often bring up a list of syntax options.

Windows
-------

Windows has two major ways to access the CLI shell: Windows Power Shell
(PS) and Command Prompt (CMD). CMD is the classic, DOS-like shell that
has all the basic commands to be able to do most of what you want;
however, PS has much more functionality and is able to take any CMD
commands and run them. PS is a lot more similar to Linux shell in syntax
as well.

### Command Prompt

  Command   Usage                                                               Syntax
  --------- ------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  cd        Changes directory                                                   &gt; cd \\directory\\subdirectory or ..\\subdirectory (.. goes up one directory)
  dir       Lists all current files and folders in a directory                  &gt; dir /a (/a shows all files and folders including hidden ones)
  mkdir     Allows creation of a new directory                                  &gt; mkdir testFolder
  copy      Copies files (or folder) to another location                        &gt; copy \\directory\\originalFile \\newDirectory\\copiedFile
  move      Moves files (or folder) to another location                         &gt; move \\directory\\originalFile \\newDirectory\\movedFile
  del       Removes files or folders (deletes permanently)                      &gt; del testFile or del /F readOnlyFile (/F allows the removal of read-only files)
  help      Shows all commands or shows documentation for a program / command   &gt; help copy
  find      Searches for a string in a file or program output                   &gt; find “testString” testFile
  exit      Ends current session                                                &gt; exit

Many commands have help files, to access them, append
&lt;code&gt;/?&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the command which will often
bring up a list of syntax options.
