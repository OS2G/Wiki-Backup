I am Dr. Quantumos, a computer wizard... in the making.

I am a jack of all trades as I am currently a master of none; however, that does mean that I know a lot about everything and am very adept at making google searches to find what I need to find. 

If you have any questions about anything, don't hesitate to contact me. I'd be happy to create a Wiki page for anything you'd like, as long as I know enough about it, or my google search proves fruitful.

#What I Can Help With#

I know a lot of general info about open-source, Linux, computers, etc.

I know a decent amount of C, so anyone in CSE 155E, I can help (stupid segmentation faults).

I can help you with your Linux installation (getting started, making sure you can dual boot, etc)

I can help you set up a server, vpn, ssh into a server, etc.

I can remove malware, usually...

#Wiki Disclaimer(?)#

Any pages I create, unless otherwise stated in a footnote or a talk page, are free reign for anyone who wants to modify, add, etc. Otherwise, if I do state otherwise, that's probably because I have big plans for a page and have simply not gotten to implementing those plans.
